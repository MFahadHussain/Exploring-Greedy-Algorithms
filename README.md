# Exploring-Greedy-Algorithms
This repository dives into the world of greedy algorithms, with a focus on Kruskal's Algorithm for solving the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. It includes the algorithm implementation, correctness and efficiency analysis, and a comparison with dynamic programming approaches.
